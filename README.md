# The Harness CLI

The Harness Command Line Interface uses a connection to a running Harness Server to do administrative tasks. 

**Note:**The CLI cannot be used to start or stop Harness, See the Harness Server documents for how to do this.

## Requirements

 - Python 3
 - A running Harness Server
 - Linux or macOS (other 'nix versions may work too)

## Setup

If you are running Harness locally on `http://localhost:9090` you can just add the CLI to your `$PATH` in `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` or wherever your OS requires, not other config is required.

## Help

In a terminal shell type `harness` to get help.
